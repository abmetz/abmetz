## :wave: Hi there!

I have over 20 years of experience in software development, technical leadership, and architectural design. I have been privileged enough to design, implement, and contribute to many successful solutions for complex and challenging business problems, many of which are still in production today.

My technical leadership, architecture skills, and pragmatic approach have driven innovation, enhanced development methodologies, improved developer experience, and ensured high-quality solutions in production and beyond.

I have worked in partnership with teams around the globe. I value openness, teamwork, collaboration, and the application of best practices, when reasonable. I have experience with Agile frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban but prefer a more pure “low overhead” Agile environment. I am adept at building AWS solutions that optimize cost-effectiveness, performance, security, scalability, reliability, and observability.

I learn best by doing and enjoy creating proof-of-concept solutions to explore how things might (or might not) work out. I find fulfillment in mentoring, sharing knowledge, and pursuing continuous growth both personally and professionally.

Let’s build something great together!
